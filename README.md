According to GitHub, repos without licensing retain all the rights over their contents, and I quote:

> "*[...]* However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. *[...]*" [^1]

Do not copy my logos, and even less logos from cited projects, as I do not own their copyright but someone else does and who knows where you could end up?

(javascript is an exception, just copy that stuff if you want i dont care lmao)
